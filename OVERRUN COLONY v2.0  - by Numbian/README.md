# FishBus Gaming Softmods Collection 1

## About this collection

This is a collection of Factorio softmods (sometimes with other origins) for the FishBus Gaming servers.  The starting goal is to take ideal functionality from several other softmods, and make it possible to have it run properly in a single server.  Later goals are sketchy as of yet.

This pack implements these mods:
- Autodeconstruct (marks miners with no resources for deconstruction);
- Autofill (with option for player to turn it off for them);
- Band (an evolved player "Tag");
- Fish Market;
- Show-Health (with option to turn it off per player);
- The entire slew of tools from ExplosiveGaming, including: Player list, server information, admin & advanced admin tools, anti-griefing, and an automatic repeating message.

Please report any issues or feature requests using the Issue tracker on https://gitlab.com/FishBus/factorio_modpack1/issues .
